# UFOs

## Overview 

The purpose of this project was to create a website, linked to a dataset of UFO sightings, that is searchable by 5 different criteria, Date, City, State, Country and Shape or descriptor. 

A link to the [html file](https://github.com/Mikeblanchard/UFOs/blob/main/UFO_Finder.html) and the [app.js](https://github.com/Mikeblanchard/UFOs/blob/main/static/app.js) provided here.

## Results

The data can be browsed or searched by one, several or all search bar criteria. Simply fill in a section and press Enter on the keyboard. If you wish to cross-reference by another search criteria, repeat the process. An example with images below:

|Blank search|First Search Refinement|Second Search Refinement|

|A fresh page displays all UFO events|An initial search of "fireball" shape retuns 7 results (not pictured)|Shape "fireball" is now cross-referenced with a city search of Atlanta to retun one result|


## Summary

One drawback of the design is the inability to search over a period, for example "show all results between 1/1/2010 and 4/10 2013". This could be relevant to people who perhaps lived in a city temporarily, and wanted to search events during that time. Additionally, we would love to see an option to view pictures and videos of the occurences through imbedded links. Perhaps exact location tags could be added through a map API as well, allowing UFO chasers to visit these places and look for patterns is where these things take place. Also perhaps flexibility in searches would be beneficial, allowing capitalization and whitespace or full state names.
